My choices for the api:

5 cars vs 1 at a time: I chose to do 5 at a time as firstly sql offers a feature to randomly sort
the cars so that makes choosing random brands easier and secondly it removes the overhead of having
to keep track of which brands you have already taken from the databse.

Base64 vs link: I chose to do base64 as although it requires more storage space it means I can 
edit the photos myself and upload them apposed to having to use someone else's logos and having those
be in different formats to what I want. I could've stored links to a cloud storage where I upload photos
but then access time gets bottlenecked based on how fast the storage can be accessed.
